# Elder ring game  
- This `repo`comes from the tutorial I was following when started with **shell scripting**. [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq6gqi9Ubog&list=PLIhvC56v63IKioClkSNDjW7iz-6TFvLwS&index=4&t=1551s)  
  
Please check the video out if you want to learn `shell scripting` in a funny way. This guy made my learning path way easier than other tutorials out there. But remember that it is intended to explain the very basics of scripting (if, case statements, user input, math etc).  
  
***Coffee break***  
  
```bash
#!/bin/zsh

if [[ YOU == newInShellScripting ]]; then
	echo "Welcome to the paradise"
else
	echo "You can probably download this repo and add a unch of new functionalities"
	exit 1
fi
```  
  
Enjoy the video and welcome to `shell scripting`
