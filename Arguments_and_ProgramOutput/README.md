# Arguments and shell output  
- To run this script you need to add to arguments when executing the script. It will look something like this:  
  
`$ ./arg_and_shellProgramsOutput.sh arg1 arg2`  
- `arg1` is to introduce a name
- `arg2` is to introduce a part of the body  
  
> **NOTE**:
> If you no add arguments, the program will treat them as empty arguments.
