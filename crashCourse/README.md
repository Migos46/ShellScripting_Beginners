# BIG THANKS to JAY LACROIX and LEARNLINUXTV  
This repo is being done as I'm learning new things about `shell` scripting with [Jay LaCoix from LearnLinuxTV](https://www.learnlinux.tv).  
Plese check him out there and also his [Patreon_Support](https://www.learnlinux.tv/support/) if you really feel like helping a bit more.

Anyways, just enjoy and share knowledge!

Do not hesitate to improve any content inside the explanations since I'm not great at explaining.
